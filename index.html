            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The School of International and Public Affairs celebrated its new Institute of Global Politics on Tuesday with an invite-only inaugural summit featuring a stacked roster of high-profile guests, scholars, and global leaders.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Columbia’s top brass and prominent donors rubbed shoulders with the likes of voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, a pair of governors, top diplomats, and two winners of the Nobel Peace Prize on the newly-renovated 15th floor of the International Affairs Building. The panels gave a first glimpse into some of the pressing political issues on the docket for the new institute, <a href="https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/news/columbia-university-launches-new-institute-global-politics">launched</a> in early September by former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and SIPA Dean Keren Yarhi-Milo to merge cutting-edge research with real-world policymaking.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “After months of dreaming, brainstorming, persuading, fundraising, planning, programming, recruiting, and, as you can see, renovating, our big day is finally here,” Yarhi-Milo said in her opening remarks. “[The institute] is the living embodiment of SIPA’s mission, our global ambition, and our commitment to evidence-based solutions and meaningful dialogue.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Yarhi-Milo said that in her first two months as dean, she began to curate a fresh vision for the future of SIPA with former University President Lee Bollinger, who offered to introduce her to Clinton. She said the pair “hit the ground running right away,” singing Clinton’s praises and describing her as a “gracious, enthusiastic, passionate, committed, brilliant partner.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “What an honor it has been to get to share ideas with you, <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/03/29/sipa-to-offer-new-fall-course-inside-the-situation-room-with-hillary-clinton-and-sipa-dean/">teach with you a class</a>, build this institute with you. You’ve become such a great mentor and friend,” Yarhi-Milo said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While Bollinger “kindled a spark” for what eventually became the Institute of Global Politics, Yarhi-Milo said University President Minouche Shafik, a global economist and <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/01/30/sipa-to-appoint-shafik-as-professor-of-international-and-public-affairs/">SIPA professor</a> herself, “helped it catch fire,” noting that the institute came to fruition in a “remarkably short time.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “You will hear more from the IGP. This will be a place that people will talk about, and it will be a place that will shape the world,” Shafik said when she took the podium after Yarhi-Milo.
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Later, Yarhi-Milo emphasized that “it takes a village” to support an effort like the Institute of Global Politics, and that community members from all corners of the University got on board with the endeavor. She also discussed the institute’s three pillars—bridging academia and policy, connecting local and global policy issues, and promoting civil discourse—and five key global policy challenges, ranging from democratic resilience to technology and innovation, before handing it over to Clinton.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Working with Keren is like working with a force of nature,” Clinton said. “Our friendship, our working relationship, is really a microcosm of what we want this institute to achieve. People with different experiences and backgrounds coming together to learn, expand their understanding of our world, and engage with opposing viewpoints and even values.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Clinton pointed to the institute’s intention of placing women at the forefront of its work and “not as an afterthought.” She said integrating women’s issues and voices is “part of the DNA” of the Institute of Global Politics and that “we have to have everyone at the table” as a model for others who will look to SIPA for inspiration.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Please be our ambassadors, be part of what we’re doing, and give us your ideas because we are truly building the plane as we’re flying it, and we want it to have a lot of velocity, a lot of altitude, and never come down,” Clinton said.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The morning’s first panel honed in on the greatest challenges facing the global economy. Shafik spoke alongside Richard Clarida, a SIPA professor and former vice chair of the Federal Reserve; <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/09/13/biden-nominates-sipa-professor-jacob-lew-to-serve-as-us-ambassador-to-israel/">Jacob Lew</a>, a SIPA professor, former secretary of the Treasury, and recently-appointed U.S. ambassador to Israel; and Joseph Stiglitz, a University professor and Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Moderator Rebecca Jarvis, the chief business, technology and economics correspondent at ABC News, began the conversation by asking about increasing inflation nationally and globally as a result of the war in Ukraine and the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The first thing to remember is that the last three years, we’ve seen the global economy really hit by a number of unprecedented, significant shocks,” Clarida said. “I refer to it as the global pandemic collapse, but not crisis. I think the reason it did not devolve into a financial crisis was because of very robust action by monetary and fiscal policymakers, especially in the U.S. but around the world.”
</p>

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The panel proceeded to discuss a wide range of issues, including the widening gap of income inequality, the dollar as the world reserve currency and cryptocurrencies, and sovereign debt.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Shafik said there was “clearly” an equality problem between countries due to fiscal tightening and “unsustainable” debt positions. She also partially attributed inequality within countries to the rise of technology. In addition to some redistribution of wealth, Shafik urged a focus on predistribution, such as investments in early education.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Turning to sovereign debt restructuring, Stiglitz brought up China as a “major creditor” that does not participate in the Paris Club, a group of officials from major creditor countries whose goal is to find solutions to debt difficulties, and Lew added that U.S.-China tensions have made it difficult to have conversations outside of “one-offs.” Giving a different example of China’s debt relationship to other countries, Stiglitz said the blame should be on China for overlending to Sri Lanka rather than only on Sri Lanka for overborrowing.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We don’t have a system. I think that’s what we’re all kind of saying,” Shafik said. “We don’t have a system for dealing with this crisis now because our old system is not suited to both the market conditions and the political conditions that we have. And for those countries, the consequences are really dire, for the Zambias and the Sri Lankas.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s a huge list,” Stiglitz chimed in.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For the final few minutes of the panel, Shafik shared her thoughts on the process of reconstruction for Ukraine and the United States’ role in supporting the country.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The scale of destruction is so vast that the level of investment required will be huge. There are already many estimates out there, in the many, many, many hundreds of billions,” Shafik said. “There will have to be huge amounts of public money, and I think the U.S. will be expected to contribute, although even that’s a very hot and difficult debate.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The second panel of the day featured Maria Ressa, Filipino-American journalist, winner of the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, and IGP fellow; Marietje Schaake, international policy director at Stanford University Cyber Policy Center; and Timothy Wu, Julius Silver Professor of Law, Science and Technology at Columbia Law School, in a discussion about artificial intelligence moderated by Nicholas Thompson, CEO of The Atlantic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The trio discussed the threats that generative artificial intelligence and large language models pose to democracy and ways to regulate new technologies.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Why are we not putting guardrails on the technology that is insidiously manipulating our emotions to change the way we see the world and ultimately the way we act?” Ressa said.

  In her time as a journalist in the Philippines, Ressa, who founded multimedia news organization Rappler, faced multiple warrants for arrest under authoritarian President Rodrigo Duterte.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “The crucial question is when should an AI product be pushed onto the market,” Schaake, who formerly served as a member of the European parliament as a representative of the Netherlands, said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I’m all in favor of doing research for the sake of understanding innovations, driving innovations,” she added. “But right now there’s no public interest process that assesses whether a new product is ready, with regard to safety, with regard to our democracy, with regard to national security, a big topic that people are concerned about.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Wu, who served as the special assistant to the president for technology and competition policy from 2021 to 2022, said governments have not done enough to tackle known harms of AI technology, specifically identifying AI that can mimic humans as dangerous.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In the next portion of the event, Yarhi-Milo presented the Institute of Global Policy’s Inaugural Carnegie Distinguished Fellows, a cohort of 14 practitioners from a range of fields. The fellows will be visiting SIPA throughout the 2023–24 academic year, collaborating with faculty on institute policy reports, and engaging with experts and students.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “With input from the faculty advisory board, Hillary and I put together an incredible, incredible, ambitious list of heads of states, industry leaders, and changemakers who are shaping global politics and public discourse,” Yarhi-Milo said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Dame Louise Richardson, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York and donor to the fellowship, briefly spoke and joined Yarhi-Milo on stage as she recognized <a href="https://igp.sipa.columbia.edu/distinguished-fellows">14 inaugural Carnegie distinguished fellows</a>, including Stacey Abrams, Maria Ressa, and Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine.

  “I couldn’t be more delighted that the first grant on my watch is to these extraordinary fellows and this wonderful program,” Richardson said. “We believe in bridging the gap between academia and policy, and through the inspirational leadership of Secretary Clinton and Dean Keren, this institute will symbolize this fusion.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Former chair of the board of trustees Jonathan Lavine, CC ’88, and trustee Victor Mendelson, CC ’89—both of whom were “founding donors” of the Institute of Global Policy, giving over $1 million each—then took the stage alongside moderator Ester Fuchs, professor of international and public affairs and political science and director of the Urban and Social Policy Program at SIPA. Lavine, a Democrat, and Mendelson, a Republican, first met as undergraduates in a class Fuchs taught and have remained friends ever since.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The pair discussed maintaining friendships despite having political differences and the importance of young people engaging with dialogue across the aisle. Lavine also discussed the role of professors and the University in encouraging those discussions.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Victor and I truly believe you can’t turn away,” Lavine said. “It is so easy to go inward, and professors have to make students feel a little bit uncomfortable. They have to almost make them argue positions that would not be their natural comfort zones.”

  Hochul and Hogan touched on several of their common beliefs—including expanding early voting, supporting police to decrease crime, and background checks for gun owners—in a conversation moderated by Andrea Mitchell, NBC News chief foreign affairs correspondent and chief Washington correspondent and host of MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports.”

  A major point of disagreement between the two was their views on a third-party run in the 2024 presidential election. Hogan, who as recently as last month said he would be open to running as a third-party candidate under the No Labels party, said that President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump were inadequate, while Hochul strongly supported Biden.

  For the last panel, two institute fellows—Yovanovitch and Henrietta Fore, former executive director of UNICEF—joined fellow women diplomats Beth Jones, former assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, representative of the United States to the United Nations, and Debora Cahn, creator of the Netflix series “The Diplomat.”

  “Compassion is something that many of our male colleagues in the earlier days thought was soft, that it was not something that should be brought to the diplomatic table … but I found that it worked,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “It worked for me. … I’ve seen it work with other women who are dealing with issues that are important but also require a sense of compassion and kindness and openness to the other side.”

  Yovanovitch, as ambassador to Ukraine in 2019, was the target of a conspiracy campaign promoted by Trump, which she described as an effort to “extort another country for personal and political gain.” She also testified against Trump in his impeachment hearings.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It was a very frightening time,” Yovanovitch said. “I couldn’t control any of that noise or what anybody else was saying or doing. But I told myself what I could do was I could control myself. … I had to get through that process with dignity.”

  “[For] many of us, and certainly me, the politics of the last ten years created sort of an overwhelming sense of powerlessness and getting to know these people. … I had this feeling of, there’s room for so many people to have such an impact,” Cahn said. “I just am glad that a few more people know, a few more students, few more young people know that this is a path that is there for the taking.”

  Former Prime Minister of New Zealand Jacinda Ardern took the stage at the end of the summit for a conversation with Clinton.

            <p class="g-body subhed">Closing Remarks</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  To cap off the event, co-chairs of the board of trustees Claire Shipman, CC ’86, SIPA ’94, and David Greenwald, Law ’83, gave brief remarks sharing their excitement about the Institute of Global Policy’s potential and SIPA’s future.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Everything for me that we heard today demonstrates so clearly the power of this IGP vision,” Shipman said. “Woven throughout so many of the sessions is the foundational need for healthy, respectful discourse.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Listening, civility, modeling all of the skills that undergird this vision, helping our students learn to reach for compromise instead of hardened rhetoric, it’s the only way to find lasting solutions to these pressing problems we’re all facing,” she added.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Everyone on the board of trustees is committed to the vision of the institute, Shipman said, and the broader goal of the University to engage with the world. She said she spent decades covering Clinton as a journalist, and while Shipman has only known Yarhi-Milo for a few years, she said they “connected instantly.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “These two are cut from the same cloth, if that is not apparent. They’re serious, brilliant women, curious, optimistic,” Shipman said “Like the IGP, they’re fluent in theory, but they are committed to getting things done. And that sensibility, I think, in many ways has always, in fact, defined SIPA.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Although Shipman said she has always been a proud SIPA alumna, she has never been more so than on Tuesday. Greenwald called the summit a “spectacular launch” and expressed certainty in the institute enhancing SIPA’s “stature as a leader in the field.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “What better place for this new forum than Columbia University in the City of New York,” Greenwald said. “As President Shafik has observed, Columbia is the most outward-looking and global of the Ivies at a time when universities have a critical role to play in addressing social or societal problems.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Columbia is positioned to be a tremendous force for positive change in the United States and around the world,” he added. “You can count on our robust support and enthusiasm.”
